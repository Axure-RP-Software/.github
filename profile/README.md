## 🧠 Overview

**Axure RP** is a Windows-based design tool created for building detailed, interactive prototypes and functional specifications. It is widely used in UX and product design workflows where behavior, logic, and structure need to be clearly demonstrated before development begins.

Unlike simple wireframing tools, Axure RP allows designers to define conditions, interactions, and dynamic content. This makes it possible to simulate real application behavior and communicate complex ideas without writing code.

Axure RP is especially useful for teams working on large or complex projects that require precise documentation. Its combination of visual design and logical interaction modeling makes it a reliable choice for professional UX work on Windows systems.
